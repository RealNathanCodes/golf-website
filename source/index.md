The Parent-Teacher Organization of St. Mary’s School in Canandaigua is excited to host its 5th Annual SMS Golf Tournament. This fundraiser was a great success the last four years, and a fun time for all who attended. We have all of our sponsors, donors, players and volunteers to thank for helping us raise money to help our school!
<br>
We look forward to the continued generosity and support of our faithful community to bless St. Mary's again in 2018.   Please go to our <a href="/sponsorship">Sponsorship</a> page or our <a href="/tickets">Golf Tournament Tickets</a> page for details on how you can support this fun event.

Come join the families, the community and supporters of St. Mary's Catholic School as we "tee off" for our 5th Annual Golf Tournament on September 9, 2018 at the Pheasant Golf Links in Shortsville NY! Lunch, including wood fired pizzas, chicken wings, and appetizers will be served at the conclusion of the tournament for all golf participants and other non-golfers who purchase a “Lunch Only” ticket.
