The Parent-Teacher Organization of St. Mary’s School in Canandaigua is excited to host its 6th Annual SMS Golf Tournament. This fundraiser was a great success the last four years, and a fun time for all who attended. We have all of our sponsors, donors, players and volunteers to thank for helping us raise money to help our school!
<br>
We look forward to the continued generosity and support of our faithful community to bless St. Mary's again in 2019.   Please go to our <a href="/sponsorship">Sponsorship</a> page or our <a href="/tickets">Golf Tournament Tickets</a> page for details on how you can support this fun event.
