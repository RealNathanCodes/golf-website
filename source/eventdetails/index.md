We are extremely excited to announce that on September 9, 2018, St. Mary’s School will host its 5th Annual Golf Tournament at Pheasant Golf Links in Shortsville NY.  We would like to invite you to be a part of this special day as an event sponsor, participant or prize donor. 
<br><br>
St. Mary’s School has been a cornerstone of education in Ontario County for the past 169 years.  The legacy of St. Mary’s is witnessed in the many graduates who have gone on to careers and colleges yet continue to lend support and allegiance to the place where they spent their formative years.  At present, there are 110 families that have children enrolled in the school.  The proceeds raised at this golf tournament will help ensure fiscal stability to continue this tradition for years to come.
<br><br>
St. Mary’s 5th Annual Golf Tournament is hosted by the school’s Parent-Teacher Organization (PTO). The event will be open to 144 golf participants and can accommodate up to 156 non-golfers purchasing "lunch only" tickets for a potential of up to 300 guests. Featured contests include a "Ball drop", "Longest drive", "closest to the pin", and other contests also included. All sponsorship signage on the course will be set up prior to the arrival of participants for registration at 8:00am and will remain in place until the conclusion around 3:00pm for maximum exposure of our sponsors.
<br><br>
Profits for all PTO sponsored events go towards the operating costs of St. Mary’s School to continue the rich tradition of a faith-based and high quality education within the community.
